- HTTP Port `3000`

### Setting a predefined host for your users
A predefined host can be set in one of two ways:

####Â Docker environment variable
If you are using the Docker image, you can set the environment variable `PREDEFINED_HOST` to your Ombi URL (including (https | http)://). This will automatically set the host for your users.

#### Running the app from source
If you are running the app from source, you can set the host by creating the file 'src/assets/settings/predefined-host.txt' and adding your Ombi URL (including (https | http)://) to it. There is an example file in the same directory.
